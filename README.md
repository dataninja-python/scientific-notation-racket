# scientific-notation-racket

This project represents a library I wrote to reduce large numbers to scientific notation to make it easier to handle calculations quickly.

In general this project will start with scientific notation but I want to eventually add the ability to represent fractions easily to do complex floating point mathematics more efficiently for the computer as well.
